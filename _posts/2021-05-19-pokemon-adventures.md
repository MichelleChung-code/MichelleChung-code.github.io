## Background
I've always been a huge fan of the Pok√©mon franchise.  This began with watching the TV series during my childhood and having "Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team" as my first Nintendo DS game.  To date, I've played through most of the Nintendo DS/3DS games (including those from the main series,  Pok√©mon Ranger, and Mystery Dungeon).  More recently, I've been continuing my journey of becoming a Pok√©mon master through Nintendo Switch games: "Let's Go Eevee", "Sword", and "Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX".  I am also the owner of the POGO AllianceCross account (friend code is 0258 2671 0038 üòâ).
