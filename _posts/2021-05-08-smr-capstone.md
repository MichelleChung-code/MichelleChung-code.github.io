Skills Used: [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html){:target="_blank"}, [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"}

In partial fulfillment of the University of Calgary Chemical Engineering Capstone project, I worked closely with another team member to model a small modular reactor based off of China's HTR-PM model in MATLAB.
