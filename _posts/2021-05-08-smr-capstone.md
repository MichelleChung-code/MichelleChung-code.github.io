In partial fulfillment of the University of Calgary Chemical Engineering Capstone project, I worked closely with another team member to model a small modular reactor based off of China's HTR-PM model in MATLAB.

A schematic of the modular configuration of the HTR-PM reactor, steam generator, and helium circulator:
