This project involved running a regression analysis on experimental data obtained from a crystallization lab. This was completed as a component of the ENCH 551 course.  The experiment cooled an aqueous solution of supersaturated potassium chloride (KCl) to induce crystal formation. Data from nine experiments was collected to investigate the effects of agitation rate and seed crystal mass (independent variables) on crystal yield, growth rate, and mean diameter (dependent variables). The objective of the regression analysis was to determine the optimal experimental conditions that would maximize these three attributes.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
